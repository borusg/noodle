- Put text/plain output in 'column -t' format

- Pretty JSON format a la Elasticsearch

- Put it all under /api/v1?  But have a convenience /_/ alias
for searching.

- Set content type and return JSON by default.  Support
returning "pretty" output as text/plain and make it match
what existing Noodle returns

- make it one giant hashie to avoid quirks like if :ilk, etc?

- plus one giant hashie makes it easier to extend?
