- fix intermittently failing tests.  There's a race condition somewhere.
Plus I'm not being careful enough with ES.  Should use this to check whether
the index exists after (re-)creating it:
http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-exists.html

At least.

- finish lib/option.rb

- magic ilk= and status= based on options

- test for bin/noodle{,.ruby} (What's the right way to test via %x?)

- noodlin script

- Put text/plain output in 'column -t' format

- Pretty JSON format a la Elasticsearch

- Move from /nodes index to /noodle/nodes.  So we can have noodle/options, etc.

- Options stored in ES noodle/options

- Only show status=enabled by default (actually, make an option
for the list of statuses shown by defaul)

- Put it all under /api/v1?  Or just /v1/?  But have a convenience /_/ alias
for searching.

- Set content type and return JSON by default.  Support
returning "pretty" output as text/plain and make it match
what existing Noodle returns

- make it one giant hashie to avoid quirks like if :ilk, etc?

- plus one giant hashie makes it easier to extend?
